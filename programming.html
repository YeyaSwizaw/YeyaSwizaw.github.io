                    <h2>Teabag</h2>
                    <p>Teabag (TilE BAsed Game engine) is a game engine I am in the process of making, written in C++, and using <a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a>. The idea behind it was to automate the loading and rendering of maps and entities, leaving the user to focus almost entirely on the game logic. It uses simple text files to define maps, tiles, entities and sprites, and events are managed using event callbacks.</p>
                    <p>Currently, it can load maps, display entities and handle events and collision, which is enough to create simple games such as a platformer or a top-down RPG. Planned features for the future include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sprite/tile animations</li>
                        <li>Better collision</li>
                        <li>Custom events (A signals and slots mechanism, perhaps)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In addition to the C++ version which can be found <a href="https://github.com/YeyaSwizaw/teabag">here</a>, there is also an OCaml version and a Haskell version, which I created to experiment with functional languages, and there is no guarentee that they will be at the same standard as the C++ version. They can be found <a href="https://github.com/YeyaSwizaw/ocaml-teabag">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/YeyaSwizaw/haskell-teabag">here</a>, respectively.</p>

                <div onclick="window.location='https://github.com/YeyaSwizaw/libworldgen'">
                    <h2>libworldgen</h2>
                    <p>libworldgen is a C++ library I created to facilitate simple generation of random 2d noise maps. It is a wrapper around <a href="http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/">libnoise</a> that hides all of the fiddling with modules and such, and tries to make it as easy as possible.</p>
                    <p>It uses noise maps, which can be configured and can either be randomly generated or combinations of others, which are then built into a map based on specified tile definitions. The map can either be made up of these tile definitions, or filled with custom objects specified in the definition.</p>
                    <p>In the future, I intend to implement my own noise function and remove the libnoise dependancy.</p>
                    <p>Its github page can be found <a href="https://github.com/YeyaSwizaw/libworldgen">here</a> and there is a (rather badly made) infinite world viewer using it <a href="https://github.com/YeyaSwizaw/WorldViewer">here</a>.

                    <h2>Befunge-to-Rust Compiler</h2>
                    <p>After descovring the existence of Rust, I decided to take one of my C++ programs and convert it to Rust so I could get to grips with the language. I chose the <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge">Befunge</a> to C compiler I had writter. It is now a Befunge to Rust compiler, written in Rust, and is much more feature-complete than the old version.</p>
                    <p>It works by making one pass over the befunge code, splitting it into areas of different states (by location, delta, and stringmode). Branching statements create new states in each direction the branch could go. It then converts all of these states into lists of actions, an internal representation of the code that will be produced. Before outputting the code it makes an optimisation pass over this, removing empty states and folding constants.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, some operations in Befunge are unfeasible to convert to actual code, namely the 'p' and 'g' operations that modify the code grid. I have made these optionally enabled, as 'variables' stored in a hash table, because this is similar to one way they can be used. This does however make certain befunge programs create incorrect code, so it is disabled by default.</p>
